	the user time of nobusy waiting program is longer than user time of busy
	waiting program

(ii)
	the program using busy wait is quicker than the program using nobusy wait
	the program with optimization is quicker than the program without optimization

(iii)
	busy waiting is quicker than nobusy waiting
	since the busy waiting does not follow the rule of FIFO which 
	means the busy waiting does not need to wait on the barging lock

(v)
	multiprocessor is always slower than uniprocessor no matter the program is using busy waiting or nobusy waiting

(vi)
	For multiprocessor, when many tasks was created, it will reduce the performance of the program.
	since tasks will spend a lot of time on contention on accessing the processor.
	For uniprocessor, tasks will not spend a lot of time on accessing the processor
	since there is only one processor. And there should be a spcific way for a uniprocessor
	to arrage the tasks.
	So uniprocessor will be faster.
