(b)
No. Not each version need to produce the same result

(c)
the minimum value is 2

(d)
The difference of size of result is because of the context switch and how the program is translated into assembly

Since multiprocess will have more context switch than single process. Thats why the size of multiprocessor is smaller 

Let A be task 1 and B be task 2
consider two situation
when A runs line1-2 but at line3, there is a  switch to B
we allow B to iterate and increment shared variable before very last iteration where a context switch occurs.
At that point i = 9999999
Then context switch to A
i = 9999999 and shared = 1
Then A run until finish, and since 1 is 9999999 we can increment shared to 2 and the program ends
