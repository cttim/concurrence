external scheduling means schedule the tasks outside the monitor and is accomplished with the accept statement. There are two indenpendent conditions (left fork and right fork) for this problem.
The externally scheduling does not know when both forks are free. Further more, external scheduling
monitor can only unblocking task which is control by the external function call. It is not possible to implement.
