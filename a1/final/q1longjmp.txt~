use 5000 5000 10000 to test

for the original
real	1m20.120s
user	1m19.789s
sys	0m0.218s

for the loongjmp version
real	0m0.268s
user	0m0.261s
sys	0m0.003s

the reason why longjmp version is quicker:
	catch/throw is aware of the objects on the stack and knows how to call the destructor 
	for objects allocated on the stack but longjmp/setjmp does nothing.

after compiled with option O2

for the original version
real	0m28.834s
user	0m28.699s
sys	0m0.074s

for the longjmp version
real	0m0.136s
user	0m0.134s
sys	0m0.002s

after compiled with option O2, the time is only half of before.

O2 option means second level of optimization which performs all other supported optimizations within the given
architechure that do not involve a space-speed trade-off, a balance between the two objects. That is why the program
will run much quicker.
